# Gekko-Strategies

A list of strategies I written up for the Gekko Trading Bot. These strategies are for educational purposes only! I do not know if they are profitable. As always, you should fully understand any strategy you use with the Gekko trading bot as you are responsible for the trades the bot makes for you. 

Fibonacci Trendlines - A trading strategy that buys when 8 day and 21 day EMA is below the 55 day EMA 
and sell when the 8 day and 21 day is above the 55.
